# Abstract
By decomposing the Collatz tree into a two-dimensional odd-even relation we show that it is sufficient to consider odd numbers (or a subset of even numbers) only using graph theory. A simple set of equations is used to build a connection graph which shows that all odd numbers are connected. We show that any valid proof that shows that all odd numbers (or a subset of even numbers) are connected without knowing their exact relation automatically proves the Collatz conjecture. Reasonable solutions solving the graph using graph theory or linear algebra are suggested.
